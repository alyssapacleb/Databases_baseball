These tables are supplemented by the following tables (shown with 3 rows of sample data): 
	
Appearances - details on the positions a player appeared at

yearID,	teamID,	lgID,	playerID,	G_all,	GS,	G_batting,	G_defense,	G_p,	G_c,	G_1b,	G_2b,	G_3b,	G_ss,	G_lf,	G_cf,	G_rf,	G_of,	G_dh,	G_ph,	G_pr

Salaries - player salary data

1985,	ATL,	NL,	bedrost01,	550000
1985,	ATL,	NL,	benedbr01,	545000
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


These datasets relate players by a specific identifier and list their different skills playing different roles. 
I want to analyze the data to determine how baseball player salary is affected by their skill and the cost of living. I plan on finding a dataset that relates the playerâ€™s salary to the US economy. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The second dataset that we are going to make connections with has to do with batters, specifically. The database can be found at this link: http://baseballguru.com/jalbright/stats.html

The table will look a little like this, and have these fields. You will notice that there is overlap between some of the fields here and in our previous dataset. 

Year LG	City Team FName	LName Pos1 Pos Bats AB R H 2B	3B HR RBI BB K AVG OBP SLG 

Each of the fields defined:
-Year: The year in which all of the data was pulled (will also be name of the file becuase the data is grouped by year. 
-LG: This is the league that the player plays in. There are two leagues, the Central League and the Pacific League.
-City: City that the player plays for.
-Team: The team that the player played for in a given year. 
-FName: The first name of the player.
-LName:The last name of the player.
-Pos1: This is a numeric value for the position being played. For example, a catcher is 2 and a 3rd baseman is 5 on the field.
-Pos: This is the actual letter for the position being played. Catcher is "C" and 3rd baseman is "3B"
-Bats: This is whether the batter bats as a lefty or a righty.
-AB:The number of at bats that each batter had; number of plate appearances
-R:The number of runs that each batter scored
-H: Times reached base because of a batted, fair ball without error by the defense

-BB: Hitter not swinging at four pitches called out of the strike zone and awarded first base
-K: Number of times that a third strike is taken or swung at and missed, or bunted foul. Catcher must catch the third strike or batter may attempt to run to first base
