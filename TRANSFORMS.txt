- As part of milestone 5, we had to cleanse the data using a short beam pipeline. When looking at our data, one of the issues that we found was that there was not a consistent naming convention for the birthCountry list in our seanlahman_modeled.players file. This meant that in some cases the countries were abbreviated, like “USA” or “P.R.” and in other cases they were written out like “Cuba” or “Mexico.” So, we created a beam pipeline that changed the names of every iteration for a country that was abbreviated, and made the country the full name. So, “USA” became “United States of America,” and “P.R.” became “Puerto Rico.” 

- Milestone 6: Date of birth is separated into three columns and they were combined into one date column. Null dates were transformed into a "dummy" date (0001-01-01).
